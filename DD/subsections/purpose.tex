The Design Document is intended to provide a deeper functional description of the SafeStreets system-to-be by giving technical and design details and describing the main architectural components as well as their interfaces and their interactions. 
The relations among the different modules are pointed out using UML standards, a traceability table and other useful diagrams showing the structure of the system. 
This document aims to guide the software development team to implement the architecture of the project, by providing a stable reference and a unified vision over all parts of the software itself and clearly defining how every part interacts with the others.

In summary the document will help the developers to create the software by referring to:

\begin{itemize}
\item A high level architecture. 
\item The design patterns to use.
\item The main components and the interfaces they provide to communicate with one another.
\item The Runtime behaviour of the system.
\item The implementation, integration and testing plan.
\end{itemize}
