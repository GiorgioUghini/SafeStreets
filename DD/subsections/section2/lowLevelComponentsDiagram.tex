In this section each component of the high level components diagram is analysed in more details, explaining
its internal structure.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Webserver} - 
    The webserver is containerized in a Docker Apache container and orchestrated by the Kubernetes service for IBM.
    This composition allows to scale the server horizontally by just adding or removing containers with few click based on the load on the server.

    \item \textbf{Cloud Object Storage}
    All the images will be stored on this component and will be accessible by a public URL. Metadata received from the computer vision service will be store here as metadata of the image they belong to.

    \item \textbf{Violations and Tickets}
    Receives violations from users and gives access to violations to officers and other microservices. It consists of a proprietary web application that exposes a REST API and is connected to a managed PostgreSQL database.

    \item \textbf{Tickets hashing system}
    Stores the hash of the violations with automatic ticket option on a database that allows only inserts and reads.
    It provides an API for the \textit{Violations and tickets} service to POST a ticket, of which it will calculate the hash,
    and for the police to send and hash for a ticket that will be compared with the one stored in its database.

    \item \textbf{Statistics}
    A simple Python application that every day, when the load on the system is low, contacts the \textit{Violations and tickets} service to grab the violations for that day and builds new statistics that stores inside its Postgres database.
    It also provides and API for users and officers to query for such statistics.

    \item \textbf{Suggestions}
    Uses the power of the \textit{computer vision} and \textit{data mining} services to identify unsafe areas and to provide
    suggestions on how to fix them. It consists of a Python application that queries data from such services and provides an API for the local police to retrieve the
    suggestions found, which are stored in a relational database.

    \item \textbf{Other services}
    The \textit{computer vision}, \textit{data mining} and \textit{User management} services are well described in other sections and do not have any components relevant here since they are pay-per-use services.
