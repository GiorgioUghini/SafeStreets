This section provides a high level diagram of the architecture of SafeStreet, listing all the microservices and how they are structured in the cloud.

\defaultFigure[1.15]{HighLevelArchitecture.png}{High level architecture}

As show from the figure above, our architecture is composed of several microservices and a web server hosted inside the IBM cloud.

The service inside the box called \textit{first line} are directly accessible for the user, so they will expose an API through a public URL.
Those inside the \textit{support} box provide functions and data to the first line service and will not be exposed outside of the IBM network.

The only purpose of the web server is to serve the static webpages for the CMS system of the local police.
