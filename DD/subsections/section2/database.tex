\subsubsection{Database}
Each microservice will have its own data storage system. All the systems must obey to the laws regarding data protection (like GDPR), which means that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sensible data such as passwords and personal information must be encrypted properly before being stored in the selected microservice.
\item Users must be granted access only upon provision of correct and valid credentials
\end{itemize}

Here we include all the E-R diagrams for all microservices
