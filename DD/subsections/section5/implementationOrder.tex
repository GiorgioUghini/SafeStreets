The first step into the implementation will be trying to understand if the chosen technologies are the one that actually are the best fit to create the SafeStreets software.
\\To do so a naive communication protocol between the Application Server and the Application Client needs to be put in place, and secondly an interface with the database needs to be done, from where should be possible to store and retrieve information.
\\The software needs to be developed one small functionality at a time, with functionalities as atomic as possible. The server side main components should be built as a priority in order to have a more efficient way of testing the application.
\\After the essential feature work it will be possible to start to develop the User Interface parts of SafeStreets.
Some functionalities need to be provided before other if some relies on them so an order of development should be put in place: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Sign up/Login manager beans
\item Report Violation manager bean
\item Automatic Report Violation manager bean
\item Data-Mining manager bean
\item Suggest for Interventions manager bean
\item Statistics manager bean
\end{itemize}
