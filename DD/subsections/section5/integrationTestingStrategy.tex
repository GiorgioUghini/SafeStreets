The integration testing strategy that is optimal with our application and that strictly follows the implementation order is the \textbf{Thread approach}. In particular, the \textbf{Bottom-up strategy} will be used to test and integrate modules within every thread. At first, only single portions of the modules (the ones that don't need any stubs) will be integrated and tested.
\\Small drivers needs to be created in order to give inputs to the portion of each module until a single feature is completed, then others threads will replicate the same procedure with the goal of reaching the completeness of the whole application.
\\Using a global strategy like this one will allow to have an application that works in the early stages of the implementation; this could permit to anticipate some testing and could minimize the costs of repair in the eventuality of an error.
