As SafeStreets has a wide user target, the main focus of our system design phase will be to create an application capable of reaching the vast majority of them. 
Thus the architecture must be designed with the intent of being very easy to use, but also maintainable and extensible, foreseeing future changes that will be applied to make SafeStreets compatible with other Police Departments.
In addition our system should be maintainable enough to keep it up to date with all the mobile phone updates that will come in the next years. 
This document aims to drive the implementation phase so that cohesion and decoupling are increased in full measure. In order to do so, individual components must not include too many unrelated functionalities and they should reduce interdependence between one another.
