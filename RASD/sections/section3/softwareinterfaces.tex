Considering the domain of our application, we  decided to integrate in our project some software components to create an easier-to-use product. 
\\In order to provide users the ability to automatically insert location info into their violation pictures meta-data, we chose to adopt a location provider service. That supplier should expose an API to retrieve the user exact address by his or her GPS position coordinates. 
\\In addition, APIs provided by the municipality are required to retrieve real time information about the accidents	that	occurred	on	the	territory	of	the	municipality to allow information mining and suggestion proposing.
\\Finally, the Local Police is required to provide an API to retrieve information about violation coming from SafeStreets users to create and process traffic ticket from it.
