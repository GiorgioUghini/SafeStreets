\subsubsection{Performance}
    The application should be able to deliver the violations (including the
    \hyperref[sec:automatic_tickets]{automatic tickets}
    ) in an acceptable time,
    which means at most 15 seconds with a 4G connection, but should average to about 5 seconds.
    This is not a strict requirement, but it improves a lot the user experience and the possibility
    that he does not decide to give up with the upload.

    The 
    \hyperref[sec:data_mining]{data mining}
    functionality is not as trivial as the delivery of the violations, but keeping in
    mind the effectiveness of the user experience it should still be able to deliver results with an
    average waiting time of 5-10 seconds, with an upper bound of 20 seconds.

    The
    \hyperref[sec:request_for_interventions]{request for interventions}
    functionality does not have any time constraints, it should just end. It can be run at any time and
    its results will be stored on persistent storage, without the need to be used immediately.
    This functionality does however consume a lot of computer resources, since it must cross a large quantity
    of data from different sources and it will also use an AI. For this reason, it will have to run
    either when the load on the system is low or on a completely separate hardware.

    All the other operations that require an internet connection (login, logout...) should be fast enough
    to not become frustrating for the user to use the application, indicatively they should take 5 seconds at most.

\subsubsection{Reliability}
    The system has no reasons to be highly available except for providing a great user experience.
    It will have to guarantee a 99.99\% availability

\subsubsection{Security}
    Since users will be able to give tickets automatically, security is a key aspect of the application.
    The information contained in the report of a violation must never be altered, and the login information
    must be kept safe to prevent hackers from giving false tickets using stolen identities.
    
    Users also give their personal data when registering, and their privacy must be guaranteed.

\subsubsection{Scalability}
    This application will be a pioneer in this field, so it is difficult to foresee how many users will
    use it and how. A high degree of scalability is therefore required. To handle the first city, Milan,
    the system must handle 1 million registered users and a peak of 10.000 concurrent requests.

\subsubsection{Accuracy}
    The maximium error that the GPS system should commit for the application to accept a position is 15 meters,
    to let an eventual officer near the violation find the car.
