As our software needs to be compliant with different laws and as it needs to interact with the Local Police, initially, SafeStreets will have a restricted geographic domain coincident with the Italiancity of Milan. \\
Indeed, in order to provide the most complete service, SafeStreets will require the access the Local Police web application to be able to process traffic tickets. \\
It goes without saying that to organize this kind of service in the most effective way we must experiment first this activity in a internationally-visible city, then applying that to anyone who will demand.
