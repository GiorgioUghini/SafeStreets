\begin{itemize}
    \item A user cannot access any of the functionality of the application if he does not register first.
        The registration approach will be similar to the one used by social media: the user will provide his first and last name, hit birthday, an email, a password and a profile picture.
        All these data will be automatically approved during the registration phase, and the user will be able to use the SafeStreets functions right away.
        a user can be banned at any time if it uses the application in a non-compliant way, for example if he sends a fake violation report.
    \item Since users could be accountable for what they do with the app (they could be banned), we suppose that they will use SafeStreets
        in the most responsible way. For this reason, all tickets that are inserted correctly will be automatically approved.
