\begin{itemize}
    \item A user cannot access any of the functionality of the application if he does not register first.
        Since security in the application is a fundamental part and users must be accountable for their reports,
        the registration approach will be similar to the one used by social media: the user will provide his first and last name, hit birthday, an email, a password, his fiscal code and a selfie/picture of himself (optional).
        All these data will be automatically approved during the registration phase, but with the possibility to be banned.
    \item Since users could be personally accountable for what they do with the app, we suppose that they will use it
        in the most responsible way. For this reason, all tickets that are inserted correctly will be automatically approved.
