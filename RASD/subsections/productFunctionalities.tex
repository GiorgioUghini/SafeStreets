This section provides an abstract of the main functions of the application. To be able to use any of the given functionalities, the user must first register and then login to the application by providing a valid email and a password.
\subsubsection{Notification of Violations}
The base function of the application is the possibility to send a picture of a traffic violation.

The user must send one or more picture(s) of the car in which both the violation and the license plate are clearly visible.

The application will try to automatically get the user position using its GPS system, and will notify the user in case of failure so that it can enter it manually.

The users will then send the following information to the system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The pictures selected by the user
    \item The position of the user
    \item The current date and time
    \item An optional comment inserted by the user
\end{itemize}
The information sent by the user will be stored on persistent storage on the server and the police will be able to see it on their clients.

\subsubsection{Data Mining}
Data mining must take into account the privacy of the users.
To guarantee an acceptable level of privacy, different roles are given to the users and the officers.

In particular, a user will only be able to see statistics provided by aggregated data, never he will see the absoulte numbers but only percentages. 

Officers, instead, will have the finest granularity: they will see all the information enriched by the actual number of violations and can drill down to the specific licence plates which committed the violations.
They will also have more filters available with respect to the users, for example the possibility to see which cars committed most violations in a given period.
