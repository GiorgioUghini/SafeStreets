\begin{itemize}
    \item A user cannot access any of the functionality of the application if he does not register first.
        Since security in the application is a fundamental part and users must be accountable for their signals,
        the registration approach will be the one used by car sharing services: the user will provide an email, 
        a password, an identity document and a selfie of himself holding such document in which his face is clearly visible.
        Also, he will provide a 4-digits code that he will have to use every time he chooses to send a ticket, even if
        he is already logged in. All these data will be approved by hand by an operator during the registration phase.
    \item Since users are personally accountable for what they do with the app, we suppose that they will use it
        in the most responsible way. For this reason, all tickets that are inserted correctly will be automatically approved.
