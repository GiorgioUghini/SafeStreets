\bf Flow of events&
Summer is a great season, there are less workers and students in the city and many of them use bikes or go to work by foot.
Every autumn, instead, people in the city start to leave their bike at home and begin to go to work by car. Matteo is perfectly aware of this situation because as always, on October his head officer sends him and his colleagues to a few intensive sessions of heavy fining to car parked in the wrong way. Matteo thinks he could do more for the city than fining people all day, and it is always bored of doing so. From when SafeStreets was introduced, citizen and normal users has becoming impressive reporter of violations and this behaving keeps growing. Having taken consciousness of this, now Matteo and his colleagues can be assigned to more meaningful tasks, for example they could be put to handle the traffic near the schools when it starts or ends. Matteo is now more happy of working and he thinks he's contributing to his city in a better way, improving the kids and their parents quality of life.\\
