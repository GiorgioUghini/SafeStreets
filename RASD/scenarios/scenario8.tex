\bf Actors&Oronzo Argento: a cutting-edge mayor and a man passing by \\
\hline
\bf Flow of events&
Oronzo is a 50 years old guy with a passion for electronics and new technologies in general. He is the mayor of a city where SafeStreets is not yet implemented. He is very much aware of the modern ways with which authorities can enforce the law and having in mind his city has a modern one he is generally prone to implement these new ways to keep citizens safe in his jurisdiction.
Oronzo's sister lives in a huge metropolis (where SafeStreets is running for some months) and he goes to her place every Sunday to have lunch and to discuss about their lives. One Sunday, after having parked his car in front of his sister's house, he notices a person on the sidewalk who is taking a series of photos of a car parked in front of a vehicles exit. Curious, Oronzo asks to the man if there were some problems, and the man replies that he was just sending a report on SafeStreets so that the police could fine the car owner. Perplexed, since it was the first time Oronzo eared about SafeStreets, he does a rapid search on the application store of his phone and proceeds to download the app. After seeing how the application works a specific chart in the statistics section 
lights up his eyes: the effectiveness of SafeStreets is amazing! The next day back to work he has already made up his mind: SafeStreets will land on Oronzo's city's streets as soon as possible.
