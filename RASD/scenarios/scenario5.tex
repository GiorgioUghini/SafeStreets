\bf Flow of events&
Life in the city, as we all know, is frenetic. Precisely for this reason, Ernesto every day after work takes his bicycle and rides it around the city's streets for 8 km.
Ernesto, however, lately feels unsafe because of those who park on the bike lane, forcing him to dodge all the cars and sometimes to do so he must leave the bike lane and ride the bike on the car lane.
One day after returning home, he tells his wife how the many cars parked irregularly today forced him to stay on the road for much longer than usual and how dangerous it was.
His wife, worried for him, advises him to consult the SafeStreets statistics to find a safer route.
Ernesto, consulting the statistics, discovers that the road he travels with his bike is classified as "unsafe area" and looking at the analytics he discovers that he could ride the same amount of km simply by going along the parallel road, on which not many violations are reported.
From the following day Ernesto changed his route and felt more secure with his new path around the city (safe) streets.
