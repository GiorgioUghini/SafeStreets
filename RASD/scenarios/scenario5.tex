\bf Flow of events&
Mobile phones are now in everyday life for many of us and Tobia is a great example. Tobia does not like to watch TV after dinner and when he is alone at home he normally spends his time on Instagram, Facebook and the various applications he has installed on his iPhone.
Sometimes, he even likes to open SafeStreets to consult the statistics of parking violations in his city.
He wouldn't ever imagined that so many violations are occurring near his area so he decides to become an active reporter in the hope of lower that number as days go by.
Consulting the analytics, he discovered that when SafeStreets was launched there were an average of 5 reported violations each day in his area.
Four months has passed from that moment and now the statistics he's seeing highlights that there are only an average of 0.9 violations each day! 
Tobia thinks this is due to SafeStreets users and he is so proud of his work, because he reported some different vehicles in the last weeks.
Tobia is seeing analytics but then he stops for a while:  he sees his avatar in the "user of the month" section. He has reported 40 parking violations just this month!
Tobia can't be more excited of this and he realizes that he would like to become a police officer in the future.
He is now finishing college and then he'll probably attend the Police Academy.
