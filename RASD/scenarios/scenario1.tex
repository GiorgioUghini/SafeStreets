\bf Flow of events&
Maurizio is driving his car to reach his girlfriend house. Once arrived, he leaves his car double parked because he don't want to spend much time looking for a park.
Mario is - as always - taking his dog out before dinner and is directed trough the park situated five minute by food. While walking, he notices that Maurizio's car is double parked and is slowing down all the cars running in the street. His dog is making more than an effort to go to the park and so Mario wouldn't have much time to call the Police to report this violation.
Meanwhile, Luca is - as always - getting back home by car. He lives outside the city and he thinks the train is not trustworthy so he chose the car. But getting out of the city at 7PM is always very slow because of the many dribbling the cars should do to avoid other cars parked on the lane and that said, he's late for the dinner with his wife.  
Mario, still in a hurry, takes out his mobile phone and opens SafeStreets app. From the homepage he create a new report and the process didn't take much time: only what is required to shoot a photo and select the double park infraction from the menu. So, after a few seconds, he was again able to walk with his dog trough the park. That day, Luca ended up arriving late at home and eating alone his cold meal. As soon as Maurizio receives the ticket from the Local Police he realize that, now that the world has SafeStreets, it's worth the time to seek a legal parking to avoid being fined again. As days go by, more car owner realize the same thing and all this ends up in Luca being able to come back home with less pain after his long days of work.\\
