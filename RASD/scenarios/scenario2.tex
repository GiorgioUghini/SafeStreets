\bf Flow of events&
As situations like double parking keeps happening in the same area as in \autoref{tab:scenarioone}, many car owner are getting more polite and respectful, but it's still not enough. Indeed, one day, Giovanni receives a letter from the mayor to find a way to help solving the city mobility problem in that area. It's a difficult problem to handle by his own and he don't have so much data and suggestion from his officers because it seems that they can't find a pattern. Giovanni is desperate but then the idea: he opens his SafeStreets control panel and see that there are suggestion not still examined. The software has detected the same double parking violation keep occurring and so it alerts Giovanni to proceed to the automatic detection of parking infractions. The automatic detection of those infraction is a mechanism, adopted by the Local Police, that consists in putting a special video camera on a Police car and then driving along the streets to automatically fine all car owners that are not compliant with the local laws. Giovanni then schedule that on next Friday, two officers would proceed this way. After that raid, fifteen different parking violations were discovered all in the same street! Without SafeStreets, Giovanni wouldn't ever imagined that such a disease was taking place in that street, but thanks to the suggestion he received, now car owners would certainly respect the law, avoiding slowing down the traffic in that street. \\
