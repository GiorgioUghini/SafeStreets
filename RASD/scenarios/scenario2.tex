\bf Actors&Vigilio Ferri: a retired helper of people in needs and a rude man\\
\hline
\bf Flow of events&
Vigilio is an active 70 years old that likes long walks and sitting on the bench in the park near his home. It's 11 A.M. and as every day Vigilio goes for his morning walk. He likes to do a lap around his neighborhood, stopping and the newsstand down the street for his daily newspaper. Walking by, he notices a huge BMW that after doing 60 km/h near the neighbor elementary school brakes vigorously and stops exactly on a park reserved for the disabled. Thinking it was an emergency and given his past as a care giver he runs to the car only to find out that is just a 30 years old man that crosses the street and goes to the barber, where he was probably late for the appointment. Annoyed by that man behavior, but most importantly knowing that her friend who is on a wheelchair lives right near that park and could need it, he takes out his smartphone, opens SafeStreets and without hesitating he proceeds to report the violation that he had just witnessed. Working with people in needs his all life he is sure that since the BMW does not have a handicap placard exposed, the ticket for the rude man is guaranteed, so he sends a report with an automatic ticket. He waits a few second and... All Done! No officers needs to come to check the violation or no authorities has to be sure that he violation occurred, the tickets is already signed and a consistent fine awaits the young man. In just over a minute Vigilio can now continue his walk knowing that he did something good for the neighborhood and for the people in need he cares about a lot.
