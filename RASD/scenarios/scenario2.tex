\bf Flow of events&
As situations like double parking keeps happening in the same area as in \autoref{tab:scenarioone}, many car owner are getting more polite and respectful, but it is still not enough. Indeed, one day, Giovanni receives a letter from the mayor asking him to find a way to help solving the city mobility problem in that area. It is a difficult problem to handle by his own and he does not have enough data and suggestions from his officers because it seems that they cannot find a pattern. Giovanni is desperate but then he has an idea: he opens his SafeStreets control panel and sees that there are suggestions not examined yet. The software has detected that the same double parking violation keeps occurring and it therefore alerts Giovanni to proceed with the automatic detection of parking infractions.
The automatic detection of such infraction is a mechanism, adopted by the Local Police, that consists in putting a special video camera on a Police car and then driving along the streets to automatically fine all car owners that are not compliant with the local laws. Giovanni schedules it for the next Friday: two officers will take care of it. After that raid, fifteen different parking violations were discovered all in the same street! Without SafeStreets, Giovanni wouldn't have ever imagined that such a disease was taking place in that street, but thanks to the suggestion he received, now car owners will certainly respect the law, avoiding slowing down the traffic in that street.
