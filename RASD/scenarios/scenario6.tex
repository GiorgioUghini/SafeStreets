\bf Actors&Alberto Legno: A frantic motorist and a new SafeStreets user\\
\hline
\bf Flow of events&
Alberto lives and works in the suburbs, however he owns a restaurant in the city for which he has to attend 3 days a week.
His local is placed in a historic area of the city where most of the parking lots present are reserved to the residents of that area, so when he does not find a valid spot, he usually proceeds to just park his motorbike where he shouldn't.
Alberto is used to take at least one traffic ticket every three weeks and he believes that it is more convenient to pay the fines rather than buying a subscription to some private parking near his restaurant.
Since the introduction of SafeStreets, its average fines have increased, however, he still thinks that is better to take some fines rather than be complaint with the law.
Since Alberto is aware of the fact that he is very often fined by SafeStreets users, he has recently downloaded the application on his mobile phone. One day Alberto, in his free time, began to consult the statistics of SafeStreets. He was shocked when he realized that in the section dedicated to the worst drivers of his restaurant area there was his license plate, reported so many times by the users to be considered a record.
He stopped for a while to think at it and he realized that it is really rude to illegally occupy the positions of those who, by right, would need them! Impersonating himself in one of the inhabitants of that area in fact, Alberto realized how difficult would have been to find parking near his home if a lot of people would occupy the residents parking lots like he does.
From that day on, Alberto stopped to illegally occupying the parking spaces reserved for residents and purchased a quarterly pass for a private parking near his restaurant.
