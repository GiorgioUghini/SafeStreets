\bf Actors&Alberto Legno: A frantic motorist and a new SafeStreets user\\
\hline
\bf Flow of events&
Alberto lives and works in the suburbs, however he runs a restaurant in the city for which he has to attend at the restaurant for 3 days a week.
His local is located in a historic area of ​​the city where all the few parking lots that are present there are reserved for residents. 
Normally Alberto takes an average of a traffic ticket every three weeks and he believes that it is more convenient to pay the fines rather than buying a subscription at some private parking near his restaurant.
Since the introduction of SafeStreets, its average fines have increased, however on balance, it is still convenient to pay fines rather than comply with the law.
Since Alberto is aware of the fact that he is very often fined by SafeStreets users, he has recently downloaded the application on his mobile phone. One day Alberto, having nothing to do, began to consult the statistics of SafeStreets. No surprise was greater when, in the section dedicated to the worst car drivers, he saw his license plate number, reported so many times by the users to be considered a record.
Alberto then stops for a while to think at it and he realizes that it is really rude to always illegally occupy the positions of those who, by right, would need them, because they lives in that area! Impersonating himself in one of the inhabitants of that area in fact, Alberto realizes how difficult would be then to find parking every day, doing a very simply action: returning back home.
From that day on, Alberto stopped to illegally occupying the parking spaces reserved for residents and purchased a quarterly pass for a private parking near his restaurant.
