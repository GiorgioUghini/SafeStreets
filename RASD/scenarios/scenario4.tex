\bf Flow of events&
Mobile phones are now in everyday life for many of us and Tobia is a great example. Tobia doesn't like too much watching TV after dinner and when he's alone at home he normally spend his time on Instagram, Facebook and the various applications he has installed on this iPhone.
Sometimes, he even likes to open SafeStreets to consult the statistics of parking violations in his city.
He wouldn't ever imagined so much violations is occurring near his area so he decides to become an active reporter in the hope of lower that number as days go by.
Consulting the analytics he discovered that when SafeStreets was launched there were an average of 5 reported violations in his area.
Four months has passed from that moment and now the statistics he's seeing highlights that there are only an average of 0.9 violation each day! 
Tobia thinks this is due to SafeStreets users and he is so proud of his work, because he reported some different vehicles in the last weeks.
Tobia is seeing analytics but then he stops for a while:  he sees his avatar in the "user of the month" section. He has reported 40 parking violation just this month!
Tobia can't be more excited of this and he then realize what is his favorite work: the Police Officer.  
Now Tobia is finishing the college and then he'll attend the Police Academy.
