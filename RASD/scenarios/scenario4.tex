\bf Flow of events&
Summer is a great season, there are less workers and students in the city and many of them use bikes or go to work by foot.
Every autumn, instead, people in the city begin to leave their bike at home and head to work by car. Matteo is perfectly aware of this situation because, as usual, on October his head officer sends him and his colleagues to a few intensive sessions of heavy fining to car parked in the wrong way. Matteo thinks he could do more for the city than fining people all day, and is always bored by it. Ever since when SafeStreets has been introduced, citizens and normal users have become impressive reporter of violations and this behaviour keeps growing. Having realized this, now Matteo and his colleagues can be assigned to more meaningful tasks, for example they could handle the traffic near the schools when it starts or ends. Matteo is now more happy of working and he thinks he's contributing to his city in a better way, improving the kids and their parents quality of life.
